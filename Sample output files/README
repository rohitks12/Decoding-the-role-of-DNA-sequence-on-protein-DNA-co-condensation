This folder contains 50 output files generated from a simulation with the homogeneous DNA. The end-to-end distance is set to 0.6 and the protein concentration is set to 84.5 micromolars.

Each file contains 5 columns.

The first column contains the particle ID of each particle present in the simulation box. 

The next 3 columns contain the position of each particle in three axis of the simulation box. 

The last column contains the TypeID associated with each particle. Here, since the sample is from simulation with homogeneous DNA, typeID associalted with all the monomers is 2 whereas typeID assigned to all the proteins is 24.
